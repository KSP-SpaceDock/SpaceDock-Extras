## SpaceDock-Extras
This repository contains all the code that we need for running SpaceDock, but that doesn't fit into the idea of a general purpose mod-hosting backend. It also contains the modules we just wanted to make.

### Modules
* profiler.py: Profiles the performance of all API endpoints
* documentation.py: Generates Webdocs using Python docstrings.
